# Clear Instagram Live (CIL)
This is a javascript bookmarklet that hides everything except the video in an Instagram Live.

Additionally, it makes the video take the entire screen, and removes the rounded corners.

**Zooming in/out will break the scale. Refresh the page and reexecute the bookmarklet to fix it.**
